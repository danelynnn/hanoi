# hanoi
by Allie

This app features an implementation of the Hanoi algorithm based on how I would have solved the game. It's a recursive algorithm.

The app supports nonstandard starting game states, and can work with rings of noncontinuous length.

Visuals are done in matplotlib, where the game states are drawn as a stacked bar graph.
